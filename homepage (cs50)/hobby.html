            <h2 class="hobby-title">Reading</h2>
            <p class="hobby-description">My favorite hobby is reading. I love it because it helps me gain knowledge, especially from non-fictional books, and it improves my mood. It also helps me imagine different things. I enjoy a mix of both fictional and non-fictional books because only reading non-fiction can sometimes get tedious, so fiction helps me relax and enjoy the process.</p>

        <section class="hobby-section">
            <h2 class="hobby-title">Cooking</h2>
            <p class="hobby-description">Another hobby I love is cooking. I enjoy trying out different recipes, which allows me to cook for myself and others. It's a relaxing activity, and a fun fact is that people often love the food I prepare. Experimenting with new ingredients and techniques is always exciting for me.</p>

        <section class="hobby-section">
            <h2 class="hobby-title">Memorable Experiences</h2>
            <p class="hobby-description">One of the best experiences I had while reading was how it helped me during presentations. The books I’ve read, like <b>Ikigai</b>, improved my research and presentation skills. For instance, I gave two presentations, one in college and another at a training center. It’s great to share my knowledge with others and feel more confident in my abilities.</p>
            <p class="hobby-description">Cooking has also given me memorable experiences, especially when I try new recipes and they turn out well. Seeing others enjoy the meals I prepare brings me happiness and encourages me to keep experimenting in the kitchen.</p>
